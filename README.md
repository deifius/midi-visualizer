MIDI Visualizer

Welcome to the MIDI Visualizer Project! This is an exciting tool for visualizing MIDI data in real time. The project aims to provide a fun and educational experience for developers, musicians, and MIDI enthusiasts. Whether you're here to contribute, learn, or just explore, we hope you'll find this project engaging and inspiring.

Getting Started

Clone this repository.

Install dependencies (if using npm or yarn):

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run start

Open http://localhost:5173 (or similar) in your browser.

Features

Real-time MIDI input using the Web MIDI API

Dynamic control panel (channels, volume, instrument switching)

Sheet music rendering

Beat and meter detection

Bar line placement based on inferred downbeats

Project Outline

High-Level Steps

Set Up the Canvas Environment

Create a drawing area using HTML5 Canvas.

Define the dimensions and ensure the canvas resizes dynamically based on the viewport.

Process MIDI Input

Use the Web MIDI API to detect connected devices.

Set up a listener for incoming MIDI events (e.g., note on, note off).

Store MIDI events in a history object for later analysis and rendering.

Render Notes to the Staff

Convert MIDI note numbers to pitches.

Calculate the horizontal position of notes based on their timestamps.

Dynamically adjust vertical positions to fit within the staff.

Draw note heads on the staff using the calculated positions.

Integrate Meter and Beat Detection

Implement a beat-detection algorithm to infer downbeats.

Use the detected beats to define meter (e.g., 4/4, 3/4).

Dynamically place bar lines on the staff based on the detected meter.

Enhance the Control Panel

Add toggles for hiding/showing instruments in the visualization.

Include a placeholder for dynamic synesthesia-style icons for each channel/instrument.

Add Interactivity

Allow users to zoom in/out and scroll through the rendered music.

Enable playback controls to replay the visualization in sync with MIDI data.

Optimize Performance

Use efficient rendering techniques to handle a large volume of MIDI events.

Implement throttling or debouncing for high-frequency MIDI messages.

Testing and Documentation

Write unit tests for critical components.

Provide clear documentation on how to use and contribute to the project.

Contributions

We welcome contributions from developers, musicians, and enthusiasts of all skill levels! Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. If you encounter any issues or have feature suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue.

Thank you for exploring the MIDI Visualizer Project. Happy coding and music-making!
